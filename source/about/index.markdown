Right now I'm officially a PhD student in Human Robot Interaction (HRI) at the Human Interface Technology Laboratory New Zealand. On the other hand. I'm also a full stack developer, prototyping freak, entrepreneur, design thinking tutor, android developer or anything else that comes up in hard or software. 

In short, I do what I love :D
