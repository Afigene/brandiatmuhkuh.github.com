There are not many things I would say I hate however there is one I do. A scientific paper with two columns. Actually any book paper whatever with 2 columns. It is realy a pain to read such pdf on a kindle or any other output files. To solve my problems I set down for 2 hours and created a small script which convertes a 2 column pdf into a nice for kindle readable pdf and sends it directly per email to my kindle.
