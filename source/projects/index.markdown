At the end of my master I had to make for a class called "Beyond the Desktop and Building Interface and Interaction Technologies" a mobil hardware prototype. Coincidentally a friend of mine who was attending this course with me got pregnant. But she had a problem. Her partner was in Norway and she was in Vienna. So we decided to create a tool to transfer the movements of the baby in her belly to the partner in Norway. This was the birth of the fetal movement prototype.

Here is a link to the paper: [Can you feel this - Sharing fetal movements over a distance](https://docs.google.com/file/d/0BydzO1mEr3Hld3pXNWluXzR5UlU)
