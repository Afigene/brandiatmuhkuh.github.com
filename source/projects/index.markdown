# Little Projects

## Twitter pos/neg stock analyser
I want to find out if the positive and negative news about a company and a companies products on twitter reflect the stock market. If yes, is twitter faster or slower than the real stock movements. 

The source can be found on my [github account](https://github.com/BrandiATMuhkuh/twitter-stock-predicter). But the project is in a very early stage. 

**Technologies Used**

* [NodeJs](nodejs.org) as easy programming environment. Awesome for prototyping
* [Twitter node package](https://npmjs.org/package/twitter) to for twitter streaming
* [Twitter Streaming API](https://dev.twitter.com/docs/streaming-apis) for realtime streaming. 

## Lets see how google maps cluster performs

## Talk with a chatbot
{% img shadowImg /images/projects/robot.jpg 300 %}
This is a proove of concept where I use only client side HRML5 tools so you can use your voice to chat with a chatbot. It should run with every modern browser, but not on mobile browsers (Mobile browser have a securit feature for recording a voice). You can try it here

For many years Flash was the dominating technologie for ebook and epaper readers. But since Flash was not working on iOS devices and it got depricated in Android 4.x it was time for a HTML5 version. The HTML5 version runs now on all modern platforms and is capable of finger and mouse gestures. The biggest free newspaper in Austria is using our implementation.

At the end of my master I had to make for a class called "Beyond the Desktop and Building Interface and Interaction Technologies" a mobil hardware prototype. Coincidentally a friend of mine who was attending this course with me got pregnant. But she had a problem. Her partner was in Norway and she was in Vienna. So we decided to create a tool to transfer the movements of the baby in her belly to the partner in Norway. This was the birth of the fetal movement prototype.

Here is a link to the paper: [Can you feel this - Sharing fetal movements over a distance](https://docs.google.com/file/d/0BydzO1mEr3Hld3pXNWluXzR5UlU)

## Tag A Price

{% img shadowImg /images/projects/screencapture-beta-tagaprice-org3.png %}
**In one sentence:** TagAPrice is a Consumer-Generated Location-Aware Price Comparison Service

This project has been created as my bachelor practicum. The idea of TagAPrice is to make the grocery market fully transparent. We buy groceries almost every day but we have no simple solution to find out where we get the cheapest product. TagAPrice tries to help to solve the problem. 

The project is divided into three main parts. First a store database. Second a product datatbase. And thind, a price database to combine the other two datasets. Right now, TagAPrice is in sleep mode. That means we have no time to develop or add more data. We tried to find investors but three years ago it was very hard to find someone who wants to support such a project. Right now, I'm working on only one part of the platform. I want to create a mobile app that uses a receipt as input and extracts all products and prices from it. As soon as this is done we can restart to integrate the data into the full project.

WERistIN was the start of my frist company I founded with my brother and this wife. The system itself builds on the "High scalable CMS" I created for a customer but we used a different business model. Our business model was built on reciprocity and pro accounts. Community like a foodball club could get access to our system for free but they had to make advertisment for us. And companies had to pay via pro account.
