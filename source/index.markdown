Right now I'm officially a PhD student in Human Robot Interaction (HRI) at the Human Interface Technology Laboratory New Zealand. On the other hand. I'm also a full stack developer, prototyping freak, entrepreneur, design thinking tutor, android developer or anything else that comes up in hard or software.

In short, I do what I love :D

## HRI/HCI Research
##### USA (2014/06 - 2014/10)
** Fuse Labs - Microsoft Research **
[{% img shadowImg http://fuse.microsoft.com/content/img/fuse_logo.png %}](http://fuse.microsoft.com/)

During my time at the FUSE Labs (Microsoft Research) I developed with Kati London and Noah Liebman a two tier tool to persuade co-workers to do more (mico)exercises during work hours. The reason for that was that most sociaties move to a more and more rigit office type workplace which creates many long term health issues. The two tier were devided into a screen based notification system and a social robot (NAO) based notification system. My main part of the project was to develop the robot side and implement it's navigation and persuasion algorithms.

**Project Presentation: ** https://mix.office.com/watch/1txuvzwh356d8 <br />
**Job tags:** research, persuasvie algorithm, robot alogrithms, python <br />

**Technologies Used**

* [Python](https://www.python.org/) Used as webserver as well as NAO script language
* [NAOqi](http://doc.aldebaran.com/2-1/naoqi/index.html) Is the SDK used to controll [NAO](https://www.aldebaran.com/en/humanoid-robot/nao-robot) robots
